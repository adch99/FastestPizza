# FastestPizza
A simple shortest path implementation for a pizza delivery company

4 Basic Things:

1. Source for the final application goes into src/
2. Documentation and notes go into docs/
3. Source and headers for things that are used in the application but can also be used as standalone libraries for other things go into lib/ such as the `Graph class` files
4. Try writing a test for each unit you make. Comes in handy while testing in the end. These go in tests/
5. The final executable goes into bin/
6. Make a separate build/ directory where you compile your stuff. Make sure it is not transported with the rest of the code.
